# 🎙 Voice-Driven-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Intelligent-Sarcasm-Detection : Hear the Unspoken 😒

*Decoding the true sentiment and subtle sarcasm hidden in human speech.*

EchoSense goes beyond literal transcription. It's an AI-powered tool that listens to what you say and understands how you say it, distinguishing genuine praise from witty sarcasm.

## 🎯 Core Features

-   🎤 *Real-time Voice Transcription*: Instantly convert spoken words into text using your microphone.
-   📊 *Precision Sentiment Analysis*: Classify text as Positive, Negative, or Neutral with high accuracy.
-   💡 *Intelligent Sarcasm Detection*: Our custom-trained model, built on the MUStARD dataset, identifies sarcasm that other tools miss.
-   🧠 *Context-Aware Engine: Understands that "Yeah, *great..." can mean two very different things based on context.
-   ✨ *Interactive Web Interface*: A clean and user-friendly dashboard built with Streamlit.

## ⚙ How It Works

The magic happens in a simple, powerful pipeline:

1.  *Capture*: Your voice is captured via the browser and sent to our Python backend.
2.  *Transcribe*: SpeechRecognition converts the audio into raw text.
3.  *Clean*: The text is preprocessed using NLTK (tokenization, stop-word removal).
4.  *Analyze*:
    * *Sentiment*: TextBlob provides an initial sentiment polarity score.
    * *Sarcasm*: Our pre-trained Scikit-learn model (using a TF-IDF vectorizer) analyzes the text for sarcastic cues.
5.  *Visualize*: The final verdict is beautifully displayed in the Streamlit interface.

## 🚀 Get Started in 3 Steps

*1. Clone the Repository*
bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/voice-sentiment-sarcasm.git](https://github.com/your-username/voice-sentiment-sarcasm.git)
cd voice-sentiment-sarcasm
`

*2. Install Dependencies*

bash
# It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m nltk.downloader punkt


*Note: You may need to install system-level libraries for PyAudio to work.*

  - *On Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev*
  - *On macOS: brew install portaudio*

*3. Run the App\!*

bash
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py


Your browser should open with the running application.

## 🧠 The Sarcasm Engine

Standard sentiment analysis tools often fail with sarcasm because they take text at face value. Our model was specifically trained on the *MUStARD dataset*, which includes text with contextual information from TV shows, providing rich examples of real-world sarcasm.

See the notebooks/train_sarcasm_model.ipynb to understand how the model was built from scratch\!
